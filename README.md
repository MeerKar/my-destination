## Introduction

This application will allow the user to make posts about their travels, including a photo, map and a summary of highlights from the trip. The user will have an account that they can log in and follow others posts.


## Problem

We faced many challenges, number one being that it took us a while to figure out how to get the blog post to POST, how to be able to log in and out and how to get the Maps to show.


## Solution

Technologies Used: Node.js, JavaScript, Express.js, Mysql, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, 
New Technologies: Cloudinary, Materialize, LeafletCSS
API: OpenStreetMap

We have a nice views interface and are able to make blog posts, signup, log in and log out. We are able to open the Map to search destinations.
