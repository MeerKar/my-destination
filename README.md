# my-destination
Project 2

This application will allow the user to make posts about their travels, including a photo, map and a summary of highlights from the trip. The user will have an account that they can log in and follow others posts.

User Story:
AS A Traveler 
I WANT an application that can share my travel experiences 
SO THAT Iâ€™m connected to the travel community

Motivation: 
We wanted an app where we could post what experiences we had while traveling and to gain inspiration from other travels, thus we wanted to develop a social media app specific to traveling.

Technologies used:  Node.js, JavaScript, Express.js, Mysql, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, 
New Technologies: Cloudinary, Materialize, LeafletCSS
API: OpenStreetMap
Tasks & roles: We all worked on/helped with mostly everything in the project; Meera & Sabrina focused on Backend and Myles focused on Frontend. Sabrina hosted the Github repo.
Challenges: We faced many challenges, number one being that it took us a while to figure out how to get the blog post to POST, how to be able to log in and out and how to get the Maps to show.
Successes: We have a nice views interface and are able to make blog posts, signup, log in and log out. We are able to open the Map to search destinations.

Future additions we would like to make:
-The ability to edit and delete posts 
-The ability to like, comment and share others posts
-The ability to attach photos to the post
